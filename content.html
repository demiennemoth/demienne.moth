      <p><strong>"We think death is silence. But it begins with a scream."</strong></p>

      <p>There’s an idea that death is a relief. That it’s soft, like sleep. That at some point you just "switch off," like an old TV. And maybe for some, it really is like that. But there’s another, far less cozy perspective that questions the very notion of "liberation." At the center of this hypothesis is not a biblical hell — but a neurobiological one.</p>

      <p>The moment between "alive" and "dead" isn’t a dot. It’s an event.</p>

      <p>Recent studies show that the brain doesn’t just keep working after cardiac arrest — it goes into overdrive, like it’s giving one final battle.</p>

      <p>In 2013, researchers at the University of Michigan (Borjigin et al.) recorded a surge of brain activity in rats for 30 seconds after clinical death. The level of synchronization and cognitive activity exceeded the norm — four times higher than in a waking state.</p>

      <p>Later in 2023, similar surges were observed in dying humans in ICU: a study published in PNAS showed gamma waves in brain areas associated with perception, memory, and consciousness. The brain was trying to... something. Record? Resist?</p>

      <p>And here we arrive at one of the most terrifying ideas — in the moment when the body can no longer be saved, the brain might experience a literal nightmare. Not philosophical — biological. Panic, primal fear, disorientation. The body is dead, but you — are trapped.</p>

      <p>Philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer believed that the root of all being is a blind will to live — an irrational urge to exist at any cost. In this light, death isn’t relief — it’s tragic irony.</p>

      <p>You may want to die, feel ready, even believe that suffering will end.</p>

      <p>But when death comes, your brain won’t ask your consciousness. It will choose to live.</p>

      <p>Which explains why many people who survived suicide attempts say:
      “I was absolutely sure I wanted to die.
      But in the moment I started suffocating / falling / drowning — I felt, for the first time, that I wanted to live.”</p>

      <p>This experience never leaves them. Many describe PTSD not because they regret the attempt — but because they witnessed, at the edge, a primal, indescribable “I DON’T WANT TO DIE,” and now they fear even the thought of death. They saw that a “peaceful death” isn’t guaranteed. Sometimes, it’s a scream you don’t wake up from.</p>

      <p>But it’s not all bleak: the brain is still a humanitarian.</p>

      <p>When it realizes there’s no hope, it turns on plan B — easing the suffering.
      A flood of endorphins, DMT, and other chemicals — a last-ditch effort to comfort the dying consciousness. These chemicals may cause euphoric sensations, hallucinations, or at least a sense of peace.</p>

      <p>This is one theory for the classic “tunnel,” “light,” and “reunions with the dead” people describe after near-death experiences. Not a bridge to heaven — but a protective illusion gifted to a dying mind.</p>

      <p>The brain dies humanely — but only after it loses its final fight for you.</p>

      <p>Not everyone faces horror. Some just — fade. Some hear silence. Some feel warmth.
      There’s no formula for death. But one thing’s clear: it’s not an instant. It’s a process. And it may be far more intense than we’d like to think.</p>

      <p>It might seem like the will to die is the strongest impulse.
      But all the things you believe about yourself dissolve in an instant — when nature takes over.</p>

      <p>You’re no longer a subject — but an instinct, condensed into an electric storm.</p>

      <p>Schopenhauer was right: will trumps consciousness.
      And in the most critical moment, you don’t whisper “I give up.”
      You scream: “Please, just one more second!”</p>
