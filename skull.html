      <h2>"We think death is silence. But it begins with a scream."</h2>
      <p>There’s an idea that death is a release. That it’s soft, like sleep. That at some point you simply "switch off" like an old TV. And maybe that’s true—for some. But there’s a darker possibility that shakes the concept of liberation itself. Not biblical hell, but neurological.</p>
      <p>The moment between "alive" and "dead" isn’t a dot. It’s an event.</p>
      <p>Recent research suggests the brain doesn’t just continue to function after the heart stops—it ramps up, going full throttle in what might be its final stand.</p>
      <p>In 2013, University of Michigan researchers (Borjigin et al.) recorded bursts of brain activity in rats within 30 seconds of clinical death. The synchronization and cognitive intensity surpassed baseline levels—over 4x higher than during wakefulness.</p>
      <p>Later, in 2023, similar spikes were found in dying human patients in ICUs. A study published in PNAS detected gamma rhythms in brain regions linked to perception, memory, and awareness. The brain was… doing something. Recording? Resisting?</p>
      <p>This brings us to a terrifying possibility: when the body is beyond saving, the brain might experience literal horror. Not poetic dread, but sheer panic. Primal fear. Disorientation. The body is gone—but you’re trapped inside.</p>
      <p>Philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer believed that behind everything lies a blind will to live—an irrational urge to persist at any cost. In that light, death isn’t peace. It’s irony.</p>
      <p>You might want to die. You might be exhausted, ready, even convinced suffering will end.</p>
      <p>But in the moment of death, your brain doesn’t ask permission. It chooses life.</p>
      <p>This explains why survivors of suicide attempts often say:
      <br>“I was sure I wanted to die. But the moment I started to drown / fall / suffocate — I felt, for the first time, how much I wanted to live.”</p>
      <p>That feeling doesn’t fade. Many experience PTSD not from the attempt, but from that raw, primal “I DON’T WANT TO DIE.” The peaceful death narrative? Not universal. Sometimes it’s a scream you can’t wake up from.</p>
      <p>But it’s not all doom. The brain has a backup plan: mercy.</p>
      <p>Endorphins, DMT, and other chemicals release once the fight is lost, offering comfort. Visions. Relief. The tunnel, the light, the dead relatives—that’s not a gateway to heaven. It’s your brain’s final illusion. A lullaby for the dying.</p>
      <p>Death isn’t instant. It’s a cascade. A process far more active than we’d like to admit.</p>
      <p>You might think your will is strongest. But in that final moment, you’re not thought. You’re nature. A storm of electricity screaming for survival.</p>
      <p>Schopenhauer was right: will beats mind.</p>
      <p>And in the end, you don’t whisper "I give up."<br>You scream: “Please, just one more second!”</p>
